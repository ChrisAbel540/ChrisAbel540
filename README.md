## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a Data Scientist with a strong background in Particle Physics, bringing a research-driven approach to solving complex data challenges. Whether it involves harnessing massive datasets, building predictive models, or developing innovative algorithms, I am passionate about leveraging data to uncover actionable insights.

Feel free to explore my repositories, which include a collection of personal projects at various stages of completion! You can also find my published journal articles via the ORCiD link.

My broader interests include Physics, Machine Learning, Data Science, and Software Engineering. Away from the screen, I spend my spare time repairing and restoring classic motorcycles. If you need anything from a quick service to a full engine rebuild, all you have to do is ask!
